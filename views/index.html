	<h2>Under Construction -- What I'm doing</h2>
  <p>This site is under construction. The goal is to provide a medium for collaboration in determining the roots of the Gestrich family. Currently, the information here is related to the descendants of Henry Gestrich -- who came from Poland to the U.S. in the late 19th century. However, I would like to include information on other Gestrich family lines, even in other countries. If you are interested in sharing information or photos to include on this website, connect with me on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/bill.gestrich</p>
	<h2>Where did the Gestrichs come from?</h2>
<table>
	<td valign="top" style="width:500px;height:300px">
		<p>While Gestrichs identified themselves as German, immigration records indicate they were living in Wysoka which is now part of Poland. This is not surprising as nearly 40% of inhabitants of Wysoka were Germans who were colonizing the region at the time. Germans living in Wysoka Poland maintained their own distinct culture -- German-speaking and practicing Lutherans -- as did the Gestrichs.</p>

<h2>Who were the first Gestrichs in the U.S. ?</h2>
<p style="width:900px;">Below are German immigration records. The top record is of Ottilie Gestrich who departed with her infant son Hugo for the United States on 8/30/1871 (my great-great-great grandomother). Her husband Heinrich Gestrich departed a few months earlier on 4/19/1871. His occupation upon arrival was a baker. They were both 25 years of age at the time. These are the oldest records I have of our ancestry in the Gestrich line. The records both list Ottilie and Heinrich's hometown as Wissek (or Wysoka)</p>
